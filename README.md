# Master-Thesis---Python-code
These Python code files are those used during my master thesis development.
The thesis is about Machine Learning techniques for Time Series forecasting, with particular reference to Covid-19 case application.
These Python lines are therefore the way by which I performed all the Time Series practical analysis, forecasts and Machine Learning models (MLPs and LSTMs).
